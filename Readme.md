# Dog-o-thon

In this hackathon, you will be working to attach events to the DOM, build upon our Dog class, link appropriate files, as well as manipulate the DOM with vanilla JS.

## Objectives

The end goal of this exercise is to have your HTML page be semi-styled with the ability to add new dogs as rows to the dog `<table>` element when you complete the form and submit it.
